# Twitter-Bot
As part of my 100 days of code, I made a Twitter Bot. This Twitter Bot will send a tweet about a YouTuber's latest video.
There are a few bugs in the program, still under construction, this can be changed by updating the url to the sign in form of twitter 
rather than trying to navigate around to the form.

I chose to do it this way so I can work on problem solving skills.As for right now I have it only sending the title of the video, I will adjust later on where it also provide
the upload date and a link to the video.

Selenium does have it problems here and there but the community on this module are so helpful, documentation is amazing as well.Please if you have any pointer for a beginner like 
me, I would like to hear you out. 

Toddles!
